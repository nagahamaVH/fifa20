## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the solver [SYMPHONY](https://projects.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY) (it's also possible to use other solver)
3. Install the packages (I recommend to use a virtual environment)
    - Install `renv` package
    - Set the working directory in the root folder of the repo
    - Run in `R` the command `renv::init()` to install all the necessary packages
